1) Student example "done right"
 - start again, in a new package, so you don't
   lose anything you already did, and this can be "clean"
 - Student has validation/protection to ensure it's always "good"
 - ArrayList<String> for courses
 - (If you can) initialize courses from variable length
   argument list
 - getName, getGpa public methods
 - *** I did NOT demo this *** create an *instance* method
   called toString takes no arguments, returns String (must
   be public)
   - you can use this as your "get pretty formatted text"
   - also if you do s.o.p(aStudent) or s.o.p("Hello " + aStudent) it will "magically" use your toString method
 - make "many" students (in an ArrayList<Student>)
 - use for (x y : z) loop form when printing
WHEN DONE RAISE HAND (and leave it up :)
IF STUCK, no more than 90 seconds before you ask for help
